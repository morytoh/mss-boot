## Getting Started

To get started with MSS Boot, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**: 
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/morytoh/mss-boot.git
   cd mss-boot
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**: Make sure you have the required tools installed. Check the documentation for a list of dependencies.

3. **Run the Application**: Follow the instructions in the documentation to run your first microservice.

## Installation

To install MSS Boot, download the latest release from our [Releases page](https://github.com/morytoh/mss-boot/releases). You will need to download the appropriate file for your operating system and execute it.

### Example for Linux

```bash
wget https://github.com/morytoh/mss-boot/releases/download/v1.0.0/mss-boot-linux
chmod +x mss-boot-linux
./mss-boot-linux
```

### Example for Windows

Download the executable from the [Releases page](https://github.com/morytoh/mss-boot/releases) and run it.

## Usage

Once installed, you can create a new microservice by running:

```bash
mss-boot create my-service
```

This command generates a new microservice with the name `my-service`. You can then customize the service as needed.

### Service Structure

The generated service will have the following structure:

```
my-service/
â”œâ”€â”€ src/
â”‚   â””â”€â”€ main/
â”‚       â””â”€â”€ java/
â”‚           â””â”€â”€ com/
â”‚               â””â”€â”€ example/
â”‚                   â””â”€â”€ myservice/
â”œâ”€â”€ Dockerfile
â””â”€â”€ README.md
```

## Configuration

MSS Boot allows you to configure various aspects of your microservice. The configuration files are located in the `src/main/resources` directory. You can set parameters such as database connections, service endpoints, and more.

### Example Configuration

```yaml
server:
  port: 8080

spring:
  datasource:
    url: jdbc:mysql://localhost:3306/mydb
    username: user
    password: password
```
